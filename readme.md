# Delete All Entry Versions plugin for Craft CMS

This deletes all entry versions, but keeps the current version of each entry, so you can revert back to it.

## Installation

The plugin is available on Packagist and can be installed using Composer. You can also download the [latest release][1] and copy the files into craft/plugins/deleteallentryversions/.

```
$ composer require carlcs/craft-deleteallentryversions
```
